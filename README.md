# hello-world
Hello there!

This is a "hello-world"- project. It's just for me, to see how GitHub actually works :-)

I'm from Austria and rather new to programming, so please don't judge me to hard :)
I hope you're having a great time, looking at my code!

That's all I wanted to say, so have a good time!
